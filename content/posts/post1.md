title: Starting the blog and creating a website
date: 2022-02-15

Hello World! I am extremely excited to start building my own website for posting about my interests which include this website. 
I have always wanted to learn front end programming as another skill in my repertoire and I am excited to start learning.
As an engineer, I am passionate about building something and the process of building my own website is extremely satisfying to watch as it gets built block by block.
