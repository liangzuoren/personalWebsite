title: Starting the blog and creating a website

Hello World! I am extremely excited to start building my own website for posting about my interests which include this website. 
I have always wanted to learn front end programming as another skill in my repertoire and I am excited to start learning.
As an engineer, I am passionate about building something and the process of building my own website is extremely satisfying to watch as it gets built block by block.

To document a bit on how this website was put together, I am utilizing Python, Flask, and Freezer to create a static webpage to host. This allows to also to create posts (as infrequently as I do) in Markdown for easy formatting and updating. For formatting, I am using Bootstrap and some CSS to do the heavy lifting. It has been an incredible learning experience so far and it definitely feels good to see a project I am working on make progress.
