			Hi, I am a passionate learner about software, machine learning, and data science. I graduated from Rice University
			in May of 2017 with a Bachelor's in Bioengineering. Throughout my schooling, I had always had an interest in things
			related to computer science. My freshman year included developing an Android application intended for Down Syndrome
			children to use that you can find on my GitHub.
