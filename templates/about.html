			Hi, I am a passionate learner about software, machine learning, and data science. I graduated from Rice University
			in May of 2017 with a Bachelor's in Bioengineering. Throughout my schooling, I had always had an interest in things
			related to computer science. My freshman year included developing an Android application intended for Down Syndrome
			children to use that you can find on my GitHub. I proceeded to lead a variety of development projects throughout my
			time at Rice, including designing and programming GUIs for neonatal CPAP devices, doing computational modeling on 
			various parts of the body such as the lungs, and creating a Mask RCNN model for deep learning on nucleus identification
			through Kaggle. I enjoy learning about machine learning topics, novel algorithms, and traveling.
