					Hi, I am a passionate learner about software, machine learning, and data science. I graduated from Rice University
					in May of 2017 with a Bachelor's in Bioengineering and once again with a Master's in Bioengineering in May of 2018. 
					Throughout my schooling, I had always had an interest in things related to computer science. My freshman year included 
					developing an Android application intended for Down Syndrome children to use that you can find on my GitHub. 
					I proceeded to lead a variety of development projects throughout my time at Rice, including designing and programming 
					GUIs for neonatal CPAP devices, doing computational modeling on  various parts of the body such as the lungs, 
					and creating a Mask RCNN model for deep learning on nucleus identification through Kaggle. I enjoy learning
					about machine learning topics, novel algorithms, and traveling.
